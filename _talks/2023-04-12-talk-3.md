I have taken a leap of faith, a leap of faith to make everyone who knows me proud of myself. As kiddish as it may sound, believe it!

I am starting my master's in Visual Computing at Universit채t des Saarlandes with the support of Saarland Informatics Campus. Visual computing refers to the field of computer science that involves processing, analyzing, synthesizing, and interpreting visual information using computational techniques. The visual computing master's program at Saarland University has been offered for the last 17 years and has matured to support today's cutting-edge research and industry needs.

Saarland University, located in Saarbr체cken, Germany, is a renowned research-oriented university offering various academic programs in multiple fields, including computer science, natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences. The Saarland Informatics Campus is a collaborative research and educational initiative in computer science. It brings together several leading research institutions, including Saarland University, the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, the Deutsches Forschungszentrum f체r K체nstliche Intelligenz (DFKI), and the Cluster of Excellence MMCI, Saarland University. Visual computing masters program is taught by the researchers of all these top institutes.

I am thankful to everyone who has helped and supported me on this journey. It takes a village to raise a child.
