In this talk I presented my team progress on PARSE 2022, a challenge hosted by MICCAI. I talked the problem statement, its significance and a challenges in the problem statements. I also discussed about Deep Learning models used for Biomedical image segmentation. This include FCN, UNET, UNET++, UNET-Tr and nn-UNET. I ended the presentation with my baseline results on PARSE 2022.
